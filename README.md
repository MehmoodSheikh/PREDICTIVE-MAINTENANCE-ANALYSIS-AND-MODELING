## Introduction

Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach to equipment maintenance that aims to predict when equipment failure might occur, thus enabling maintenance to be performed just in time to prevent the failure. This project focuses on implementing various machine learning models to analyze historical maintenance data, identify patterns, and predict future failures.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains historical maintenance records including equipment details, maintenance logs, and failure history. It is sourced from [insert source here] and consists of [insert number] records spanning over [insert time period].

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before building predictive models, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. EDA involves:

- Statistical summaries to describe the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset.
- Data visualization using plots such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize distributions, relationships between variables, and identify outliers.
- Correlation analysis to measure the strength and direction of linear relationships between numerical variables.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection is a crucial step in building effective predictive models. In addition to traditional techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance scores, the following advanced techniques are used:

- **Hill Climbing Algorithm**: A heuristic search algorithm used to find the best subset of features that maximizes the performance of the predictive model. It starts with an initial subset of features and iteratively adds or removes features based on the improvement in model performance.
- - **Random Forest Feature Importance**: Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. One of its advantages is the ability to compute feature importance scores, which indicate the contribution of each feature to the model's predictive performance. Features with higher importance scores are considered more influential in predicting the target variable.

## Models and Techniques

Several machine learning algorithms are implemented in this project to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. These include:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It predicts the class of a given data point by majority voting of its k nearest neighbors.
- **Decision Trees**: A tree-based model that splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features. It is interpretable and can handle both numerical and categorical data.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between features. It is widely used for classification tasks.
- **Neural Networks**: A deep learning model composed of interconnected layers of neurons. It is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in the data.
